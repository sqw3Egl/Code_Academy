String Methods
Review

Excellent work! This lesson has shown you the vast variety of string methods and their power. Whatever the problem you are trying to solve, if you are working with strings then string methods are likely going to be part of the solution.

Over this lesson you’ve learned:

    .upper(), .title(), and .lower() adjust the casing of your string.
    .split() takes a string and creates a list of substrings.
    .join() takes a list of strings and creates a string.
    .strip() cleans off whitespace, or other noise from the beginning and end of a string.
    .replace() replaces all instances of a character/string in a string with another character/string.
    .find() searches a string for a character/string and returns the index value that character/string is found at.
    .format() and f-strings allow you to interpolate a string with variables.

Well I’ve been stringing you along for long enough, let’s get some more practice in!
