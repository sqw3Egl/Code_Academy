Off-Platform Project: Reggie's Linear Regression

In this project, you’ll combine your knowledge of lists, loops, and syntax to help a mad scientist perform some calculations on his data.

Complete this project on your own computer. To do this, you’ll need to install Python. Follow the directions below, if you’re interested.
Working on Your Computer

    If you’ve never used the command line, we recommend taking the Learn the Command Line course.
    Install Python by following the directions in this article on Installing Python.
    Learn about Jupyter Notebooks, a cool way of combining Python code with explanations or instruction in a web terminal.
    Download the Linear Regression project. Unzip it by double-clicking on it. In the terminal, navigate to the directory containing the project, and type:

    jupyter notebook

    This should open a browser tab.
    Click on Reggie_Linear_Regression_Skeleton.ipynb in the browser tab. This will open up your Jupyter Notebook.
    Follow the steps in the Jupyter Notebook. If you get stuck, you can look at Reggie_Linear_Regression_Solution.ipynb for the answer.
